    "# 1.0 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our nation is on the brink of a demographic transformation, one which will force our society to change in more ways than one. Although our healthcare system is still recovering from seismic shocks of the Covid-19 pandemic and its effect can still be felt in our society, we must now face another formidable adversary (Halvorsen, 2020) - our aging population. The research question is as follows: How much is the 'Eldrebølgen' expected to affect the demand for certain healthcare professions in different regions of Norway?\n",
    "We wish to analytics and data science, in combination with visual elements and predictive modeling, to stay vigilant of potential shortages in parts of our healthcare workforce. \n",

    "### e11search Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Main research question:\n",
    "How much is the 'Eldrebølgen' expected to affect the demand for certain healthcare professions in different regions of Norway?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub questions other key questions/ information that we will be answering along the way in order to provide a complete overview of the problem at hand:\n",
    "What are the current regional disparities in the employment and demand for Sykepleier, Helsefagarbeider, and Hjelpepleier?\n",
    "Which regions are most likely to face shortages, and what are the potential implications for healthcare delivery in those areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is th 12s .2 importais The possibility of being able to inform minicipalities and potentially even the government about the future demand for certain healthcare professions \n",
    "\n",
    "This project serves multiple purposes such as to:\n",
    "Spread and better the awareness around this particular issue through diagrams, plots, and other visual aids. In that way, the consequences might seem much more tangible and real to those who remain largely unaware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivate the younger generation to choose a career path projected to be one of the largest growth industries in Norway in the future (Aursand, 2023). Not only would the demand be high, but the profession itself would be critical to society and potentially fulfilling work for the individuals. \n",
    "Promote cooperation and communication among experts and those who are simply passionate to produce strategic solutions by further highlighting the growing need for healthcare related services and its workforce (Johnson & Johnson, 2023).    \n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid needlessly taxing our healthcare system in the future when we could have been engaged in preemptive countermeasures presently (Dolonen, 2018).\n",
    "Serve as a socioeconomic success story for other nations. Although each country has a different set of circumstances and varying resources to allocate freely, and there is most likely not a one-size-fits-all solution to an aging wave, other nations might be able to implement some of the solutions which we used in order to solve this problem we share among certain nations (Blix & Ågotnes, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Proposed analytics solution\n",
    "We propose an analytical solution with three parts:\n",
    "- Use Linear Regression to create a prediction for all the professions we have chosen to include in this study. \n",
    "- Utilize an ARIMA model to make a prediction of the elderly population will look like in each municipality included in this study.\n",
    "- Use the Cobb-Douglas function to model the relationship between the predicted number of nurses, for example, and the elderly population across the municipalities. \n",

    "##  2.0 Methodology Data Collection and Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hariac eatfWia/Helse5Dwst:lS  20ed from Statistics Norway (SSB), specifically from this table: SSB Healthcare Workforce Data. The dataset, named 'Helse50.csv,' includes data from 2008 to 2022. It was imported using Pandas in Python: data = pd.read_csv('/Users/lime/Desktop/Helse50.csv', delimiter=';', skiprows=1, header=1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Population Data: Also obtained from SSB, from this table: SSB Population Data. Initially, the dataset focused on the same 50 regions as the workforce data and includes data from 1986 to 2023. However, it's important to note that after making models for workforce prediction, only 20 regions were retained for analysis in the CSV file 'Folketall.csv,' which covers the same time range. The dataset was imported with: df = pd.read_csv('/Users/lime/Downloads/Folketall.csv', delimiter='\\t', encoding='ISO-8859-1').\n",
    "\n",
    "Population Prediction Data: An additional dataset, for population predictions, sourced from this table: SSB Population Prediction Data. It includes data from 2022 to 2035 and was imported using: df = pd.read_csv('/Users/lime/Downloads/MMM.csv', delimiter=';', skiprows=1, header=None, encoding='ISO-8859-1'). This dataset is used for comparing actual population data with future predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Region Selection and Data Processinefinement of Healthcare Workforce Da\n",
    "ta: The healthcare workforce data underwent a significant refinement process. Categories 'hjelpearbeider' and 'omsorgsarbeider' were excluded due to the introduction of the 'helsefagarbeider' term in 2006, which encompasses these roles. This change was reflected in the data from 2010 onwards, showing a decline in the older categories. Before downloading the 'Helse50.csv' file, empty rows marked with \"\" were filled with the median value of the row to ensure data completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population Data Cleaning: For the population data, the primary cleaning step involved combining the counts of men and women to create a gender-neutral dataset. Additionally, the age groups 67-79, 80-89, and 90+ were consolidated into a single category labeled '67+'. This simplification was aimed at streamlining the analysis and focusing on broader age demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID-19 Impact and Region Exclusion: Analysis of the healthcare workforce data revealed significant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic in many regions. Regions with a workforce decrease of more than 7% from 2019 to 2020 were excluded to avoid skewing the linear model. Regions with anomalous spikes, such as those showing a doubling of values within a year, were also excluded as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Dataset Composition: The final dataset, after thorough cleaning and processing, provided a more accurate and reliable foundation for analysis. It included regions with consistent data trends and excluded those with significant disruptions or anomalies. This approach ensured a robust and meaningful analysis of the healthcare workforce distribution and demographic structure in Norway.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2.1 Healthcare Workers\n",
    " focused on 'Eldrebølgen,' the aging wave increasingly affecting the population, it is crucial to identify and analyze the most relevant healthcare professions. In this section, we will explore some of the critical healthcare professions that play a central role in elderly care, with a particular focus on nurses (Sykepleier), health workers (Helsefabarbeider), and Doctors(Lege). Various studies and literature sources have been used to underscore the significance of these professions in providing healthcare services, especially to the elderly population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2A doctor (Lege) is a trained medical professionl specializing in diagnosing, treating, and preventing illnesses, holding a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree. With the elderly population's heightened vulnerability to chronic diseases, physicians, as specialized healthcare professionals, play a vital role in elderly health. Older individuals and their families often turn to physicians for advice on issues related to physical or cognitive decline and changes in care arrangements (Oh & Rabins, 2019; Sedhom & Barile, 2017). Caring for the elderly requires empathy, specialized training, and emotional support, making physicians' attitudes and decision-making criteria crucial in providing suitable care for elderly patients (Guidet et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "A nurse (Sykepleier) is a healthcare professional with a nursing degree and licensure dedicated to providing direct patient care, coordinating healthcare services, and fostering wellness in collaboration with the healthcare team. In the realm of healthcare, RNs act as proactive guardians, ensuring the safety of elderly patients amid the challenges of their fragmented care (Lindberg et al., 2022). Beyond traditional caregiving, these nurses are adept leaders, skillfully overseeing and tailoring care for older adults. Their diverse skills, including trust-building, continuous learning, and effective coordination, are widely recognized and valued by the healthcare community, families, and the elderly (Lillsjö et al., 2023). This acknowledgment underscores the pivotal role of RNs in providing a secure and personalized healthcare experience within patients' familiar surroundings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Healthcare workers (Helsefabarbeider) provide the most care when no nurses are around (Hanson et al., 2002; Frogatt et al., 2006). These dedicated professionals go beyond their roles, forming special bonds with the elderly residents. They find fulfillment in meeting their physical needs and upholding their dignity through respectful support. Despite the inevitable challenges that come with aging, as highlighted by Holmberg et al. (2019), these healthcare workers play a crucial role in fostering enduring connections and ensuring the elderly feel valued and understood in their journey.\n",

    "Answering the So What?:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessity to address the demand for Helsefagarbeider, Sykepleier, and Hjelpepleier in anticipation of Norway's 'Eldrebølgen' is primarily a practical concern with far-reaching implications. The \"so what?\" factor lies in the tangible outcomes of this issue on our healthcare system and society at large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of these professions transcends their job descriptions; they are crucial in maintaining the quality of care for the elderly population. Adequately meeting the demand for these roles is essential for the sustainability of our healthcare services. A shortfall in these critical areas could result in strained healthcare resources, decreased quality of care, and potentially higher healthcare expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the issue carries significant ethical weight. Providing sufficient care for the elderly is a societal responsibility and reflects our commitment to ensuring their well-being. The focus on Helsefagarbeider, Sykepleier, and Hjelpepleier is indicative of our societal resolve to support and care for our aging population. Essentially, the “so what?” is about pragmatic foresight. It's about recognizing and addressing the upcoming demographic changes proactively to ensure that our healthcare system remains robust and responsive to the needs of all citizens, especially the most vulnerable.\n",
